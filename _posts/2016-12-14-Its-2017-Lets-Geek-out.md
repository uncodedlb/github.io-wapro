## It's 2017, Let's Geek Out!

Ok, as I write this, it's not quite 2017.  But January *is* almost here. And  it's been a while since we all came together to geek out... Let's do this!

**Topics:**  Web Development 2017 + Lightning Talks.  
**Venue:**  WE Labs.  
**Day/Week:**  Tue/Thu (depending on venue).  

Do you have a preference on Topics or day/week?  Shout out on FB or Twitter.  Even if we can't do it in Jan, we'll absolutely consider as we move forward in 2017.  If you're interested in presenting on a topic, please [contact](/about/) the organizer, Mike Stewart.
