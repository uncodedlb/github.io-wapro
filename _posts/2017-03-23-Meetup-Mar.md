  presentation_title: Displaying User Generated Content (UGC)â€”This is a Javascript talk
  presentation_desc: "At Adobe (Livefyre) we help publishers and marketers engage with their audiences via user generated content (UGC). Starting with conversations using our comments, reviews and rating apps and moving into Media Walls, Carousels, Maps, Live Blogs, Sidenotes, etc. In most of these we display third party UGC from places like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, and YouTube.

I'll walk though how the data from diverse sources is normalized and how different apps display the UGC. We display the UGC within our curation tools as well as our frontend apps. There is an evolution to how we've tried to best display UGC. I'll talk about what works and what doesn't work. This is a Javascript talk.

Livefyre is Adobe's UGC content platform. We are deployed on some of the most trafficked news sites. We have curate rules pulling in specific client defined content from the Twitter firehouse, Facebook API, Instagram API, etc. We deal with massive amounts of data and page views. For example 2.5B requests per day to via stream API, 1MM pieces of content added to apps dally, and 2.1MM documents indexed to search daily. We will look at how we display all this content to users."

  presentation_title: "The story and tech behind Scriptworthy, a cloud-based screenwriting app made in Long Beach"
  presentation_desc: "[Scriptworthy](https://scriptworthy.co) started as a
 hobby project a year ago and has since grown into a secure,
 subscription-based service quietly launched in early 2017. With a little
 marketing, it's already become a useful tool for hundreds of
 screenwriters and continues to evolve based on their usage patterns and
 direct feedback. Come hear the story of how it began, see how it works,
 and share your thoughts on how far it could go. This talk will cover the
 pragmatic approach to building SaaS apps and the various technologies
 involved: in this case, PHP, Javascript, CSS, MySQL, cloud servers, and
 more. Q&A to follow, depending on audience interest and time allotted."

### ABOUT WAPRO

The Long Beach Web & App Professionals (#WAPRO) group meets monthly to share and learn about the technology that ignites our imagination, builds our skill-set, expands our network, and grows community!

### MEETING TOPICS

In the past we've had professionals present that have worked on projects such as Spacex, Riot Games, X-prize, Adobe, Toyota Motor Sports, VMWare, UCLA, CSULB, AARP, and more ... using technologies such as [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [Bower](http://bower.io), [Browserfy](http://browserify.org/), [Headless Drupal](https://github.com/davidhwang/horseman), [iOS Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/), [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/), [Node.js](https://iojs.org/en/), [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/), [Sculpin](http://sculpin.io), [Zapier](http://zapier.com) and more.

Every month we come together to:

* Demo technologies we use, especially those driving the convergence of websites and mobile apps
* Showcase our projects built with cool tech
* Share industry "best practices"
* Newcomer Q&A's
* Network, get to know each other, and otherwise have fun

We have a preference for open-source software, especially server-side. This year we have meetups focused on the life-cycle and technologies related to website and application development. We will especially try to delve into situations where mobile and web technologies converge. The meeting topics we cover will vary monthly and will be tailored to, and by, our community. Want to see something in particual? Let us know by tweeting using the hash #WAPRO.

If you have interest or work in Web or Application Development, add our meetup to your calendar now and join us! Our meetups are FREE and open to [EVERYONE](https://github.com/uncodedlb/uncoded-policies).
