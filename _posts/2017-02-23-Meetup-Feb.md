We had a great meetup in January and hoping for more good times & sharing at Gunn-Jerkins (near Long Beach Airport). I'm still putting together details for this month... more info posted soon! But I could use your help and input as we continue to work out details for presentations, venues, topics, etc. If you or someone you know would like to come share about App or Web development either this month or in the future, please contact us: [www.waprorlb.org/contact/](/contact)

With your suggestions we'll continue to improve the WAPRO format in 2017\. Our goals are to entice locals and guests to come share and inspire with best practices, interesting and/or fun projects, and cool tech tricks.

**Upcoming meetup dates:** â˜ƒ 2/23 â›µ 3/21 ðŸŒ· 4/20 ðŸŒ¤ 5/16 â›µ 6/22

### ABOUT WAPRO

The Long Beach Web & App Professionals (#WAPRO) group meets monthly to share and learn about the technology that ignites our imagination, builds our skill-set, expands our network, and grows community!

### MEETING TOPICS

In the past we've had professionals present that have worked on projects such as Spacex, Riot Games, X-prize, Adobe, Toyota Motor Sports, VMWare, UCLA, CSULB, AARP, and more ... using technologies such as [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [Bower](http://bower.io), [Browserfy](http://browserify.org/), [Headless Drupal](https://github.com/davidhwang/horseman), [iOS Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/), [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/), [Node.js](https://iojs.org/en/), [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/), [Sculpin](http://sculpin.io), [Zapier](http://zapier.com) and more.

Every month we come together to:

* Demo technologies we use, especially those driving the convergence of websites and mobile apps
* Showcase our projects built with cool tech
* Share industry "best practices"
* Newcomer Q&A's
* Network, get to know each other, and otherwise have fun

We have a preference for open-source software, especially server-side. This year we have meetups focused on the life-cycle and technologies related to website and application development. We will especially try to delve into situations where mobile and web technologies converge. The meeting topics we cover will vary monthly and will be tailored to, and by, our community. Want to see something in particual? Let us know by tweeting using the hash #WAPRO.

If you have interest or work in Web or Application Development, add our meetup to your calendar now and join us! Our meetups are FREE and open to [EVERYONE](https://github.com/uncodedlb/uncoded-policies).
