    Open Source evangelist, community organizer, Long Beach native. From enterprise I.T. to consulting.  Ultimately, licensing independence for his clients plus the discovery of the principles behind free software, led him to Drupal as a veritable swiss-army-knife for the web, and more generally the promotion and use of freedom software.

This meetup kicks off the 2018 with a bang— join us for a talk on Augmented Reality (AR) at the grand opening of [Ironfire](http://ironfire.co) (a new coworking space in Long Beach)! And its also the start of monthly WAPRO meetups again! 

If we have time, we’ll also have a chance for community lightning talks and/or round-table discussion on the state of tech in Long Beach.
