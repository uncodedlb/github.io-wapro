ON BEING A PYTHONISTA AND DJANGONAUT  

Python has never quite been the hot language du jour, but it has a large and loyal following both on and of the web. It’s equally at home as a systems scripting tool, advanced maths environment, and Web application language. The language syntax and design philosophy favors simplicity and idiomatic style. As briefly as possible I’ll take you on a tour of the Python ecosystem, particularly as it relates to Web application development.

> ### Roger Howard [@rogerhoward](http://twitter.com/rogerhoward)

> Long Beach Local, Roger Howard, has spent over 15 years in large organizations such as Playboy, Fox, The Getty, and Blizzard Entertainment providing technology leadership, hands on engineering, and process innovation.
>
> My specialties generally center around the design and delivery of large collections of data and digital media in museums, photo agencies, video game studios, and other high-volume media environments.
>
> These days I work independently as a programmer, consultant, and occasional technical writer.

**Presentation**  
RAPID iOS PROTOTYPING WITH SWIFT

Let's fire up Xcode and build and iOS prototype application in under 10 minutes...no coding necessary. Forget about using those trendy prototyping frameworks that try to provide a "real" iOS feel, our prototype will be fully NATIVE with no limitations.
