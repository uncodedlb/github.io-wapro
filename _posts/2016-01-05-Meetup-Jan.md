##VALUE

Tech moves too fast to keep up on everything yourself.  There's always someone faster, better, or smarter than you.  Come meet them, connect, and lean on community.  If you're a local business or agency, join us and encourage staff to come.  It's a great way to expand your network of folks active and connected, which leads to both new business and potential new recruits.  Everyone wins!


##TOPICS

The Pros that have worked on/for projects such as Spacex, Riot Games, X-prize, Adobe, Toyota Motor Sports, VMWare, UCLA, CSULB, AARP, and more ... have shared amazing talks this year on tech and projects such as [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [Bower](http://bower.io), [Browserfy](http://browserify.org/), [Headless Drupal](https://github.com/davidhwang/horseman), [iOS Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/), [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/), [Node.js](https://iojs.org/en/), [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/), [Sculpin](http://sculpin.io), [Zapier](http://zapier.com) and more.

Every month we come together to:

* Demo technologies we use, especially those driving the convergence of websites and mobile apps
* Showcase our projects built with cool tech
* Share industry "best practices"
* Newcomer Q&A's
* Network, get to know each other, and otherwise have fun

We have a preference for open-source software, especially server-side.  This year we have meetups focused on the life-cycle and technologies related to website and application development.  We will especially try to delve into situations where mobile and web technologies converge.  The meeting topics we cover will vary monthly and will be tailored to, and by, our community.  Want to see something in particual?  Let us know by tweeting using the hash #WAPRO.  

**Future meetup dates:**  10/6  ⛅  11/3  ⛈  12/1  ☔  1/5  ☃

If you have interest or work in Web or Application Development, add our meetup to your calendar now and join us! Our meetups are FREE and open to [EVERYONE](https://github.com/uncodedlb/uncoded-policies).
