Whether you're an app developer, web developer, use `php`, `python`, `node`, `dotnet`, `ruby`, `go` (or another language), there's a recipe or workflow that will make your life more productive and powerful.

    Open Source evangelist, community organizer, Long Beach native. From enterprise I.T. to consulting.  Ultimately, licensing independence for his clients plus the discovery of the principles behind free software, led him to Drupal as a veritable swiss-army-knife for the web, and more generally the promotion and use of freedom software.

This meetup is an end of year celebration plus a prelude to 2018—we'll start having regular WAPRO meetups again!  Luckily, we'll also have our last chance to see Roger Howard present locally on tech.  Come learn about [Docker](https://www.docker.com/what-docker), a key part of Roger's development workflow.  If you're not using it yet, now is your chance to kick the tires with a pro (and before he moves to the east coast)! If you are using it, its a good chance to contrast, compare, and ask questions.  We'll also share some awesome docker related tools, too!

If we have time, <!--break--> we'll also have a chance for community lightning talks and/or round-table discussion on the state of tech in Long Beach.  

Note the venue for the meetup.  [JLOOP](https://www.jloop.com/) (across the street from [Fingerprints music](http://fingerprintsmusic.com/)) was kind enough to host on short notice, but has limited space.  

After the meetup, everyone is invited to walk down to a local pub for some buisness networking.  Join us!
